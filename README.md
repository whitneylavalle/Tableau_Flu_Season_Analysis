# Tableau_Flu_Season_Analysis
This repository contains a Tableau-centered analysis of flu season data. It utilizes CDC data on influenza deaths and child vaccination rates along with US Census Bureau population data to inform medical staffing strategy for a temp agency. 

I first used Excel to source, profile, and quality-check the data. I subsequently conducted data transformation and integration, conducted statistical analysis, statistical hypothesis testing, created visualizations with the resulting data set, and finally consolidated by analytical insights into a report. Requirements of this project fulfilled by the final report include:

1. Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing
and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
2. Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal,
does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
3. Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-,
medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
4. Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.

The attached PDF details data limitations and quality as well as goals for monitoring the proposed staffing changes' impact via KPIs. The below Tableau link shows the final presentation. The Vimeo link contains an audio presentation of the Tableau report.
